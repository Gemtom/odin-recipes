<h2>Description</h2>
<p>I made this dish with Hatch chiles that I had in my freezer and some onions and mushrooms that needed to be used. I served it over a bed of cilantro-lime rice. I shredded my chicken breast and mixed it in with the rice. Hubby preferred his chicken breast whole. We're going through a stay-at-home order due to the Coronavirus pandemic and this was a great meal to make with items that I already had.</p>
<h3>Ingridients</h3>
<ul>
<li>cooking spray </li>
<li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>

    <li>Broil the chile peppers until skin is heavily blistered and turning black, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
